# Final Project

Students pitch an AI solution, but they must present its **complete lifecycle**, including its hardware needs, environmental impact, and data sources. Students select one "AI Use Case" (e.g., AI for Homework, AI for Medicine).

Exercise: Create a visual "Stack Map" for their use case:

- Where the minerals come from.
- Which GPU they would use.
- How much power it consumes.
- How they will recycle the hardware later.

Deliverable: A 3-minute "Pitch" to the class.
